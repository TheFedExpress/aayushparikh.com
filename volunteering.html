    <h2>First Racquet</h2>
    <p>Giving back through tennis has been one of the most meaningful parts of my life. I'm the director of the Austin branch of <strong><a href="https://firstracquet.org" target="_blank">First Racquet</a></strong>, a nonprofit originally founded in Houston. Our goal is to make tennis more accessible for kids who wouldn't otherwise have the chance to play.</p>
    
    <p>So far, I have organized two successful tournaments with multiple draws of young kids eager to play for the charity. Through these events and ongoing collection efforts, we gathered boxes of rackets, shoes, clothing, strings, and balls, which we shipped to underprivileged children in Angola. Through this work, I've learned that leadership isn't about recognition; it's about consistency. Whether I'm coordinating volunteers or sorting gear, I'm reminded that small actions can have a big impact when done with purpose.</p>

    <h2>National Junior Honor Society (NJHS)</h2>
    <p>During my time in NJHS, I contributed to various community service projects and initiatives. This experience helped me develop a commitment to service and reinforced the importance of giving back to the community.</p>
