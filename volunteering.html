    <p>Giving back through tennis has been one of the most meaningful parts of my life. I'm the director of the Austin branch of <strong>First Racquet</strong>, a nonprofit originally founded in Houston. Our goal is to make tennis more accessible for kids who wouldn't otherwise have the chance to play.</p>
    <p>We organize tournaments and collect donations—rackets, shoes, clothing, strings, and balls—which we send to underprivileged children in Angola. Through this work, I've learned that leadership isn't about recognition; it's about consistency. Whether I'm coordinating volunteers or sorting gear, I'm reminded that small actions can have a big impact when done with purpose.</p>
