    <p>I approach academics with the same mindset I bring to tennis—consistent effort and curiosity. My main focus is STEM, but I also value a balanced education that includes language, music, and the humanities.</p>

    <h2>Coursework and APs</h2>
    <p>Algebra 1 & 2, Geometry, AP Precalculus (5), AP Statistics (5), AP Physics 1 (5), AP Human Geography (5), AP Computer Science A (4)</p>
    <p>Currently enrolled in AP Calculus BC and Advanced Computer Science 1</p>

    <h2>Achievements</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>SAT: 1570</li>
      <li>National Honor Society (NHS)</li>
      <li>National Junior Honor Society (NJHS)</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>STEM Journey</h2>
    <p>My interest in STEM began early. In third grade, I joined FIRST LEGO League (FLL), where my team competed against college-level groups. By middle school, I was building and programming EV3 robots to complete household tasks like mopping. Later, I learned Python and experimented with Raspberry Pi, exploring how software can interact with the real world.</p>

    <h2>Electives</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>3 years of Spanish</li>
      <li>4 years of Orchestra</li>
    </ul>

    <p>I enjoy the logic behind mathematics and the creativity within engineering. Both remind me that the best solutions come from patience and precision.</p>
