    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>
      I am honest, dedicated, relentless, and patient. Currently a junior at Westwood High School, 
      I balance rigorous academics, competitive tennis, and meaningful volunteering. 
    </p>
    <p>
      Beyond the classroom and the court, I enjoy reading fiction, solving Rubik’s cubes, and practicing taekwondo. 
      My curiosity for problem-solving extends to technology as well—I began coding with robotics in elementary school 
      and have since grown into programming with Python and Raspberry Pi.
    </p>
    <p>
      Looking forward, I aim to continue excelling in tennis and academics while pursuing opportunities 
      that challenge me to learn, grow, and give back to my community.
    </p>
