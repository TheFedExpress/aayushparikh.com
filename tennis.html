    <p>Tennis has shaped how I think and who I am.</p>
    
    <h2>Freshman Year</h2>
    <p>I joined the Round Rock High School varsity team as the youngest player, competing at line 2. I fought hard through every match, helping my team reach Bi-Districts.</p>
    
    <h2>Sophomore Year</h2>
    <p>I transferred to Westwood High School, a program known for its intensity and discipline. The transition was tough, but I learned how to adapt. That season, I played line 1 doubles and line 6 singles, and we went on to win the state championship. One of my proudest moments came during a spring match that lasted nearly five hours and ended past 10 p.m. I won by the narrowest margin, proving to myself that endurance and mental strength matter as much as talent.</p>
    
    <h2>Junior Year</h2>
    <p>I was named team captain and now play line 3 doubles and line 4 singles. Our team has reached the state semifinals, and I've found that leadership is less about giving instructions and more about setting an example—staying composed, competing with integrity, and encouraging others.</p>
    
    <p>Tennis has taught me how to compete hard without losing perspective. Every match is a lesson in patience, strategy, and emotional control.</p>
