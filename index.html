    <p>Hi, I'm Aayush Parikh, a junior at Westwood High School with a deep interest in STEM and a lifelong connection to tennis. I believe in steady progress, whether it's in academics, competition, or personal growth.</p>
    <p>I started high school at Round Rock, where I was the youngest player on the varsity tennis team. After transferring to Westwood, I faced new challenges—adapting to a more competitive environment both academically and athletically. The transition taught me resilience, and I'm proud to have helped lead my new team to a state championship. That experience showed me the value of staying focused and composed under pressure.</p>
    <p>Outside of tennis, I enjoy reading fiction, solving Rubik's cubes, hiking, and swimming in the ocean. I'm drawn to activities that test both patience and problem-solving. I've learned that progress often comes from persistence rather than perfection.</p>
