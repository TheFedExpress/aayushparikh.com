    <p>Hi, I'm Aayush Parikh.</p>
    <p>I'm a junior at Westwood High School with a strong focus on academics and a lifelong connection to tennis. My greatest strength lies in STEM, where I've developed a deep understanding of physics, calculus, and computer science. I enjoy learning how things work at their core—how physical laws, numbers, and logic fit together to explain the world. I love exploring new coding languages and applying what I learn to solve real problems. My dad works as a Senior Digital Designer for Mixed-Signal SoCs, and I've always enjoyed watching him design and analyze circuits. Seeing how theory becomes engineering has shaped the way I approach challenges: with patience, precision, and curiosity.</p>
    <p>That same mindset carries into tennis. My connection to the sport began when I was three years old, holding a pink, dented Wilson racket. My dad would roll a ball toward me, and I'd swing again and again, not realizing how much that moment would define me. By the time I was five, I was playing on real courts, and when I turned seven, I started formal coaching and tournaments. What began as a game soon became a lifelong passion that taught me focus and resilience—the same traits that drive me in academics.</p>
    <p>I started high school at Round Rock, where I was the youngest player on the varsity tennis team. Competing against older players taught me to stay composed under pressure. When I transferred to Westwood, I entered a more demanding academic and athletic environment. The transition tested my adaptability, but it also helped me grow. I'm proud to have helped lead my new team to a state championship while keeping academics my top priority.</p>
    <p>Outside of school and tennis, I enjoy reading fiction, solving Rubik's cubes, hiking, and swimming in the ocean. I'm drawn to challenges that test both the mind and body. Through everything I do, I've learned that progress comes from steady effort, not perfection.</p>
    <p>Whether I'm studying, competing, or building something new, I aim to stay curious, stay focused, and keep improving one step at a time.</p>
