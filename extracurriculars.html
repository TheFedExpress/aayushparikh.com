  <main>
    <p>My interests go beyond academics and tennis. I'm a black belt in taekwondo, a skill that taught me discipline and control. I used to play soccer and still enjoy staying active outdoors. I love hiking and camping, especially trips like Angel's Landing in Zion National Park or camping in freezing temperatures with my dad.</p>
    <p>At home, I often unwind by reading fiction or timing myself on the Rubik's cube, which I can solve in under thirty seconds. These hobbies may seem small, but they keep me grounded and remind me that focus can turn into progress in almost anything.</p>
